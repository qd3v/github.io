--><h3>Languages</h3><p>This group of languages I know very vell (some of them I don't use anymore, though)</p><ul><li>
<strong>Ruby</strong> - today is my primary language I use since 2011, and feel myself very comportable with it.
For a few last years there are rumors what Ruby is dying, but trust me - it's allright with language, there's a problem on how pepople use it.
I'm about monkey-patching, God classes and other bad practicies.
Ruby gives a lot of freedom, and because of that requires a lot of developer's responsibility.
That's why principles such as SOLID, works so good for Ruby - they prevent developers from wrong language using (take
a look at my favorite examples - <a href="http://hanamirb.org/" target="_blank">Hanami framework</a>
or <a href="http://dry-rb.org/" target="_blank">DRY* gems family</a>).

</li><li>
<strong>*sh</strong> - every developer must feel comfortable with at least one of them, and knowing their different tricks and edge-cases.
*sh itself not very hard to learn.
Much more important to learn common tools provided by *nix and tasks they allow to complete.

</li><li>
<strong>PHP</strong> - I don't use PHP anymore, but this was my primary language for more that 10 years.
I stopped using it when PHP began to demonstrate features of solid language like namepsaces, but that was too late for me.

</li><li>
<strong>C#</strong> - I don't use it anymore, but that was a great experience, and I believe it will help me with Java

</li><li>
<strong>PL/pgSQL</strong> - I love it! Actually it's my first declarative language I started to learn, looks a bit clumsy, but feels so powerful. Threre wasn't much tasks there I could learn it more, but every time it's an interesting experience.

</li><li>
<strong>Lua</strong> - using for creating custom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ConTeXt" target="_blank">ConTeXt</a> writers for <a href="http://pandoc.org/README.html" target="_blank">Pandoc</a> (I love parsers and books! :).
Easy to learn, have unusual RegExp engine, and not much popular...

</li></ul><p>The languages below I'm currenlty learning one by one. As soon as my knowlege and practical using of them will be enought, I will move them to the upper list.</p><ul><li><strong>Elixir/Phoenix</strong> - this is what I'm curently actively learning, and I love it!

</li><li><strong>Elm</strong> - crazy thing, but looks so sexy to me. Quick touch give some nice results, but I just don't
need frontend lang right now.

</li><li>
<strong>Java</strong> - though I have some experience with Java many years ago (before C# came into scene), I realized what since then Java world changed a lot.
Practically speaking I'm learning Java from the start, but thanks to C# experiance this process is quite fast.
One of the main goals I have - developing Android apps
</li><li>
<strong>Clojure/ClojureScript</strong> - this is the next language I plan to learn. Maybe before/after Elm, it depends on how things will go.
There are tree reasons: get functional, ClojureScript as fronted lang and Elisp.



</li></ul><h3>Ruby gems</h3><p>
It's easier to list only major ones: Rack (hello, <a href="https://github.com/elixir-plug/plug" target="_blank">Plug</a> :) ) Rails, Grape, Hanami, DRY* gems family, Statemachines (any), Devise/Warden,
Pundit/Protector/Cancancan, OmniAuth, PDF generation gems, Capistrano, Sidekiq/SuckerPunch, RSpec, Webmock, VCR, Capybara, tons of them...


</p><h3>Databases</h3><ul><li>
<strong>PostgreSQL</strong> - this is my favorite RDBMS since I begin to use Rails.
My experience include: all the common stuff, administration/migration, triggers, rules, functions, materialized views, table patitioning, PL/pgPSQL, extensions like cube, uuid-ossp, hstore and so on.
I'm not a PostgreSQL guru, but it's always interesting for me to learn something new about it.

</li><li>
<strong>MySQL</strong> - I do not use that one for years, but used since 1998.
In other words I'm not interested in MySQL after I met PostgreSQL.

</li><li>
<strong>Redis</strong> - I began to use it in my own project when the trend of NoSQL started back to year 2010 (approx).

</li><li>
<strong>MongoDB</strong> - I began to use it at the same time as Redis within the same project

</li><li>
<strong>Elasticsearch</strong> - never used, but actually this is my next DB to learn, I believe that will be very interesting


</li></ul><h3>API's integration</h3><ul><li>
<a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Braintree</strong></a> - sales registration, settlement, void, webhooks. Features usually required
</li><li>
<a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/" target="_blank"><strong>Firebase Authentication</strong></a> - used this one for authentication for a client with API project. I needed some additional features, so I created custom <a href="https://github.com/hassox/warden" target="_blank">Warden</a> strategy to handle JWT authentication. Also I've added Firebase Authentication to Android app prototype for the same project (Java).
</li><li>
<a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/" target="blank"><strong>Firebase Cloud Messaging</strong></a> - very good API understading (direct notifications/group notifications etc.)
</li><li>
<a href="https://www.twilio.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Twilio</strong></a> - this API I learned very well since I was responsible to refactor complex communication part of recent project.
</li><li>
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/wallet/" target="_blank"><strong>Apple Passbook API</strong></a> (Web, Pushes and Pass format itself). I used all of these while creating <a href="/works/#bestfit" target="_blank">this</a> app.
</li><li>
<a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Slack</strong></a> - easy integration, nothing interesting: fancy bot messages with images and so on
</li><li>
<a href="https://rollbar.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Rollbar</strong></a> - error tracking service
</li><li>
<a href="http://newrelic.com/" target="_blank"><strong>NewRelic</strong></a> - famous easy and configurable app monitoring and analytics (used for Rails and Sidekiq app)
</li><li>
<a href="https://acoustid.org/webservice" target="_blank"><strong>AcoustID</strong></a> - service providing search in music database by audio fingerprints
</li><li>
<a href="https://wiki.musicbrainz.org/Development/JSON_Web_Service" target="_blank"><strong>MusicBrainz</strong></a> - huge music database you can search against
</li><li>
<a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Cover_Art_Archive/API" target="_blank"><strong>Cover Art Archive</strong></a> - found track name? use this API to get vinyl cover image :)
</li><li>
<a href="https://airbrake.io/" target="_blank"><strong>Airbrake</strong></a> - very useful, but overpriced, service for tracking runtime errors
</li><li>
<a href="https://papertrailapp.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Papertrail</strong></a> - log management, easy to setup, nothing too huge here
</li><li>
<a href="https://deadmanssnitch.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Dead Man’s Snitch</strong></a> - small service for trackin' cron jobs running


</li></ul><h3>DevOps</h3><ul><li><strong>Tools</strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.ansible.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Ansible</strong></a> - this perl is my &num;1 tool if I'm working on DevOps. It (or to be more specific one of it's galaxy's <a href="https://github.com/ansistrano/deploy" target="_blank">Ansistrano</a> role) even replaced me <a href="http://capistranorb.com/" target="_blank">Capistrano</a> which was my favorite deploy tool for years.</li><li><a href="http://capistranorb.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Capistrano</strong></a> - yup, Ruby's deploy workhorse. This was no-choice option for deploy for me for years (yes, I heard about <a href="https://github.com/mina-deploy/mina" target="_blank">Mina</a>, but there's no sense to use it when you have Ansible now)</li><li><a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Vagrant</strong></a> - any fancy multi-machine configuration (very useful for networking prototyping). Paired with Ansible provisioning, these two form a very powerful tool.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Services</strong><ul><li><strong>Amazon EC2</strong></li><li><strong>Amazon S3</strong></li><li><strong>Amazon RDS</strong></li><li><strong>Amazon SES</strong> (including DNS configuration)</li><li><strong>Amazon Elastic Beanstalk</strong></li><li><strong>Amazon EC2 Containers</strong> (learning)</li></ul></li></ul><p>I have a little experience with Heroku, but none of my clients actually used it. Anyway, that should not be a trouble.</p><h3>Operating systems</h3><ul><li>
<strong>OS X</strong> - my primary every-day OS

</li><li>
<strong>Debian family</strong> - my previous main OS (ubuntu particulary). Now I'm using it for deployment/containers

</li><li>
<strong>FreeBSD</strong> - my favorite server OS I use for my own dedicated server

</li><li>
<strong>ArchLinux/Gentoo</strong> - 'cause it's fun and healthy for brain :)

</li><li>
<strong>Windows</strong> - games only, nothing interesting there

</li></ul><h3>Front end</h3><p>
<strong>There's a lot of frontend tools I use, but I use them for my personal projects, and not looking for frontend related job. Quick fixes, nothing more. So this section I'll keep empty</strong>
</p></div></div><!-- END OF SKILLS LIST --><!-- MY STORY --><div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col"><a name="story"></a><div class="ik-my-story"><h2 class="mdl-typography--text-center mdl-typography--font-thin mdl-typography--text-uppercase">My story</h2><h3>The beginning</h3><p>
I began to develop websites in 1998 year. It's all began with well-known PHPNuke
CMS. While hacking it around and learning PHP, I began to understand that
PHPNuke is based on very ugly spagetti code, and developers used all the bad
programming habbits writing it. Anyway, thanks to PHPNuke, I learned PHP well,
but began to look for something more elegant.

</p><h3>DotNet Developing</h3><p>
Thus, in 2003, C# and ASP.Net came into my life. I was very excited with C# and
till now think it's one of the beautiful languages with strong toolkit, provided
by .Net Framework and supported by amazing MS Visual Studio. To be honest, I
think MS have only three products what world is really need to have: Windows 7,
.Net, DirectX.
</p><p>
While learning C#, I wrote few desktop applications, and one simple site with
MySQL connection. The more I develop on .Net, the more I tired to write all this
huge amount of code need to do simple tasks. Even MSVS & Resharper didn't help
much.
</p><p>

This time my decision was to finalize desktop and Windows development, and get
back to more interesting for me web backend development using PHP. At the same
time I migrated to Linux from Windows, cause PHP developing on Linux is more
natural.

</p><h3>PHP Again</h3><p>
After returning to web development, as any developer with few years of
experience, I decided to develop my own framework, using all I knew, to
make something handy for me in everyday work, and to consolidate all my
knowledge. Inspired by great .Net libraries and many books I read till
then, I began to work, and the final result was almost completely
satisfy me - it had a simple ORM, routing system, and built a lot like
MVC pattern. I've made two sites using it, but began to understand, that
the whole architecture could be better: I had to wrote too many things
to make it work, and should be a way to avoid it. And in that moment I
stepped to the next level: I began to read others code.
</p><p>
In those days a boom of PHP frameworks happened: Zend, Codeiniter,
Cakephp, an AST.net-style Qcodo & Prado. Looking at how they solves my
framework's problems, a decided what my experiment with own framework
was finished. It helped my a lot with understanding of how to design
systems's architecture, how to make system more decoupled etc. Now I had
to choose my favorite framework for every-day using, and learn it
completely.

</p><h3>Kohana framework</h3><p>
After some experiments (and one site done on) with Qcodo, I've noticed
dejavu: this is too familiar with ASP.net - again to much code, and
actually this is not a PHP style of coding. And then, in 2008, Kohana
(2.1 as I remember) came into my life...

</p><p>
This was it! Simple, elegant, great organized and designed, with
excellent ORM... I loved it, and untill I become familliar with RoR and
Ruby, I used only Kohana in my work.

</p><h3>TDD: Brain revolution</h3><p>
At those time the TDD & Agile concept became more and more popular, and
this was my next step to another level. It was not so easy to completely
change the way I used to work, and it took about a year to make it a
habbit - write tests before code. But TDD, especially in complex
applications, and if you do it right, really saves time as I noticed
later.

</p><h3>The great RoR migration</h3><p>
Using Kohana, I often read that it's very basic PHP port of something
called Ruby on Rails, written on mysterious Ruby language. Thus,
finally, I decided to take a look at RoR, as if Kohana is so great,
maybe RoR is something fantastic...
</p><p>
And so in 2011 I find a RoR video course at Lynda.com, and was excited
how great RoR is. My dream became true: I can write so little code
(thanks to Ruby) to do so amazing things.
</p><p>
I really regret I didn't met RoR and Ruby earlier, and that regret led
to another experience level: since then, I'm trying to be on the edge of
backed development technologies, to not to miss something really
interesting and making my life simpler.

</p><h3>Spec the Ruby</h3><p>
After RoR inspiration and digging in its code, I've realised what I
should learn Ruby language itself first, to read and understand what
actually happening there. Since by that time I was a huge fan of TDD,
I've started to search a tool for testing (and documenting my Ruby
research at the same time), and find Rspec. That was another shock,
comparable with RoR itself. I've fell in love with the expressiveness of
Rspec (again, thanks to Ruby), and till today I can't imagine my work
without it.
</p><p>
After few months of learning Ruby and RoR through Rspec & Capybara, I
decided to forget about PHP, and completely switch to RoR, like many
others PHP developers.

</p><h3>Nirvana</h3><p>
In the beginning of 2012 I felt I'm ready for my first RoR commercial
project. And so was made quite simple abc-logistik.ru, and later
pelesend.com, and higginsmd420.com. The internal complexity of
applications grows in the same order.
</p><p>
It's been a long time since I've switched to Ruby and it's ecosystem,
but still, every day I'm using it, I'm learning beautiful things,
interesting ways of solving problems, finding myself, finally, at home.

</p><h3>Programming future</h3><p>
Today I'm learning Elixir/Phoenix and building own little service using them.
It's always better to learn something by example. I'm creating only
backend part now, and if things will go well, I will need web-client for it.
This is the moment there I should decide which lang, CJ or Elm will be the
best for me and project to use for front-end.
